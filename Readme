# Flask sample app

This repository includes a minimal Flask application with pytest tests, a Dockerfile, and a CI workflow.

## Files added
- app/__init__.py — create_app() with two routes: `/` and `/health`
- app/main.py — application entrypoint
- tests/test_app.py — pytest test cases
- requirements.txt — runtime + test dependencies
- Dockerfile — builds a small image using gunicorn
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — runs pytest and validates the Dockerfile build

## Run locally
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install deps:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:5000/ or:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/
   ```

## Run tests
```bash
pytest -q
```

## Docker
Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t flask-sample .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-sample
```

## How to add these files to your repo and open a PR
Copy these files into your local checkout, then:

```bash
# create a branch locally
git checkout -b add/flask-sample

# stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add sample Flask app, tests, Dockerfile and CI workflow"

# push to remote (this will create the branch on GitHub)
git push -u origin add/flask-sample
```

Then create a pull request in the GitHub UI.

Note: I attempted to create the branch remotely on your behalf, but your repository currently has no commits (it's empty), so I couldn't create a branch there. Pushing the branch from your local copy will create the branch and the initial commit on GitHub.

If you'd like, I can:
- generate the exact git patch for these files that you can apply locally, or
- create a single multi-file patch (diff) you can apply, or
- after you push the branch, open a draft PR template for you.

Tell me which of those you prefer and I’ll produce it next.
